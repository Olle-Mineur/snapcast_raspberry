# Setup for other rooms

Of couse Snapcast would be overkill if we just had one client or atleast plans for multiple clients. Therefore we "need" satellite clients and for this I will just use a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.

## Hardware used

This is flexibel, but here I did not have much laying around so I looked around for cheap options.

- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, get one with headers
- DAC for Raspberry Pi. Either USB or a HAT
- Audio cable
- Speaker with AUX input or RCA
- Optional: can add a rotary encoder for changing volume for this speaker
